# MY LEARNING PROGRESS  
  ---  
  ## last update
  - [x] *Made the site live*
  --- 
* Building this site was a handfull i create a site that i liked but then quicckly realised it was meant to be paired coding.
* We all then got to gether and streamed our pages on discord and helped each other with what we wanted in each other site and how things should be built
  1. color schemes and styling of the site 
  2. the content within the site
  3. we gave our own flare to the site i.e grid/flexbox/tables/bootstrap/scss

## CONCEPTS LEARNT:
* Quickly adapting to new enviroments 
* learning new skills such as MarkDown and why it's used
* helping other and understanding there code aswell as them understanding mine to work around bugs
* i personal learnt sass on top and realised it's power also about colour marking your brackets to help find which one you you need to be in.
* html/css is fun i have a lot of practise in this area, such as flex box. But i did not know grid at all but now i do and its structure i love it this course has really improved my coding skills
* GIT aka the bane of my existence!!!  
    1. this is used for pushing to githubs site
    2. you begin with a git init
    3. you add . or add index.html  (adding all files or just one)
    4. then you commit with a good message to show your changes.
    5. get the github repo link from the repo you created on github or someone else's github 
    6. git push "link" 
    7. **_STILL NEED HELP USING BRANCHES_**
